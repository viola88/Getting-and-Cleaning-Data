Codebook

This codebook contains a description of the variables dataset and dataclone. 

Dataset
Contains 10299 rows, 68 columns

Person
the index of person involved in the experiments, value between 1 to 30

Activity
One of the six Activity this person did:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

Resulting Columns 3 to 68
Compare the infos on features for this. These columns contain the result of the experiment used on this person with the according activity. Different signals are measured and different functions applied on these signals. Here, only those signals are considered where mean or standard deviation is computed. The labels X and Y stand for the direction. The names of these Columns are the following: 

"tBodyAcc-mean()-X" 
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Y" 
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Z" 
"tBodyAcc-std()-X" 
"tBodyAcc-std()-Y" 
"tBodyAcc-std()-Z"

dataclone
consists of 180 rows and 68 columns

Person
The index of the person involved in the experiment, as above

Activity
The activity this person is performing, as above

Columns 3 to 68
Same columnnames as before, this time the average of each variable is taken and sorted /grouped by the Person and the activity this person is performing (that's the reason for the reduced column number).
